I am a second year Masters student in the Computer Science department at the [University of California - San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My experience spans across various fields within computer science. At present, I am primarily focused on Systems and Security. I have expertise in languages like Go, Java, C/C++, JavaScript, and Python. I have also worked on projects involving web development, distributed systems, robotics, and IoT, you can checkout my work [here](/projects/).

Beyond academics, I genuinely enjoy the process of learning, whether it's picking up a new programming language, studying an academic topic, or even learning to play a new games. I find joy in expanding my knowledge and continuously challenging myself to grasp new concepts and skills. In my free time I love playing [Chess](https://www.chess.com/member/samarth9201) or Badminton.

I thrive on connecting with new people, exchanging ideas, and collaborating. Please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samarthbhadane/) or by [Email](mailto:sbhadane@ucsd.edu) - I'm always eager to build my network. I'm currently seeking full-time software engineering roles and would love to learn about opportunities that align with my experience. If you come across an opening that fits my profile, I would appreciate you passing it along via email. I'm passionate about developing my skills and am excited to join a team where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow.
